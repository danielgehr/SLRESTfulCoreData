# SLRESTfulCoreData for Valser Service AG

This is a fork of the [SLRESTfulCoreData repository](https://github.com/OliverLetterer/SLRESTfulCoreData), adjusted for the code basis of the Valser Service iOS App.
https://github.com/OliverLetterer/SLCoreDataStackIt's .podspec file contains the fixed versions of [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking) and [SLCoreDataStack](), which are used in the project.

It was initialy forked and changed by [Christoph Lipp](https://github.com/ser1us), who then deleted the fork on his GitHub account.
That's why I created a new fork, copied Christoph Lipps custom code to my new repo and linked to my new branch in the pod file.

But best practice would be to remove all deprecated pods and replace them with new versions.
